Plasmids: <br />
pMS81 (https://benchling.com/s/seq-R4EH8NBa1F1H664YrV7B)<br />
This is the primary donor homology plasmid for split integration. <br />
pMS79 (https://benchling.com/s/seq-D33sAg6kZoLrCvr13n8J)<br />
This is the Cas9 & guide combo plasmid which targets the syntheitc landing pad <br />
pZCS16 (https://benchling.com/s/seq-054XEhkchQaadFDv1u7G)<br />
If a co-marker is desired for marking arrays (generally speaking we do not recommend doing this). This is our recommended co-marker. <br />
PX696 (https://benchling.com/s/seq-QKhVdT5ErPJdqrRh8Sw1) <br />
This is the insertion strain sequence. <br />
